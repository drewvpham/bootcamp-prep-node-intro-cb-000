# Bootcamp Prep Node Intro

Hello! Welcome to the Introduction to Node course in the Community Bootcamp! 

Before beginning this course, I'd like to give you a few bits of advice. First of all, this materials was designed to be very fast paced. It was designed assuming students had completed the rest of the course before beginning. This means we aren't going to go over the basics of how the internet works or anything similar that that. If the words `GET` and `PUT` make no sense to you, go back and complete the Rails section.

Also, this material is _not_ an introduction to Javascript. Go back a few units to get a deep understanding of Javascript. Once you have a good understanding of Javascript and a good understanding of Rails and how the internet works, then begin! Enjoy the magical world of Node and Express :)

Thanks!
